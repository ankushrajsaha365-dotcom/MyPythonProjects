# 1. What is an Exception?

An exception is a **runtime error**.

## Common Examples

- Dividing by zero  
- Converting invalid input to `int`  
- Accessing a file that doesn’t exist  

## Basic Try-Except Syntax

```python
try:
    # risky code
except ErrorType:
    # what to do if error occurs

```
